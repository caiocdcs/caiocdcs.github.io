## Why I'm Writing

This is my first blog post ever. After over a decade of developing software, I've never had the courage to write about it. I finally decided to take the leap.

Three things drove me to start this blog:

- **Solidify my understanding**: Writing forces me to truly grasp what I'm learning
- **Give back to the community**: I want to contribute to the same community that taught me so much
- **Push my boundaries**: Writing sounds terrifying, but that's exactly why I need to do it

## Topics

I'll write about:
- **Programming languages exploration** (currently Zig, but always trying new ones)
- **Java** (work stuff)
- Problems I'm solving
- Tools that work
- Things that don't work

## What's Next

Keep learning, keep sharing, keep growing.

Thanks for reading - I hope you'll join this journey of continuous discovery and improvement. Happy coding!
