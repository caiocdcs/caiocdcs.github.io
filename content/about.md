I'm **Caio Silva**, a Brazilian Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in software development. What started as a career has evolved into a genuine passion for crafting solutions and exploring new technologies.

Computer Science graduate from **UNICAMP** (Universidade Estadual de Campinas). Currently working as a full-time software engineer, constantly learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.

## Technical Journey

My journey began in the Java ecosystem, which remains my home base. There's something deeply satisfying about Java's tooling maturity and the depth of its ecosystem. Along the way, Go taught me the value of simplicity and the power of fast prototyping.

Recently, I've been venturing into newer territories - I learned Rust last year and I'm currently exploring Zig. I keep a curious eye on other interesting languages like Janet and Gleam. I've discovered that I genuinely enjoy the process of learning new programming languages and the fresh perspectives they bring.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Perfecting my cold brew technique
- Exploring craft beers
- Reading (both technical and fiction)
- Experimenting with dessert recipes in the kitchen
- Tending to my plants
